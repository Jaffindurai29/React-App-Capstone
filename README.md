## Installation

Follow these steps to install and set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone[ https://github.com/Jaffindurai29/React-App-Capstone.git](https://github.com/Jaffindurai29/React-App-Capstone)
   ```

2. **Navigate to the project directory:**

   ```bash
   cd React-App-Capstone
   ```

3. **Install the dependencies:**

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

   or, if you prefer using yarn:

   ```bash
   yarn install
   ```

## Running the App

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server:

```bash
npm start
```

or, if using yarn:

```bash
yarn start
```

This will start the app in development mode. Open your browser and navigate to [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it.

## Building the App

To build the app for production, run:

```bash
npm run build
```

or, if using yarn:

```bash
yarn build
```

This will create an optimized production build in the `build` directory.

## Testing

If your project includes tests, you can run them with:

```bash
npm test
```

or, if using yarn:

```bash
yarn test
```
